Reanalysis of correlation between ecology and conservation status
=================================================================

This is all essentially just to make sure everything still makes sense.

Ordered multi-logit on conservation status.

Habitat, trophic category, body size, geographic range, phylogenetic position.

Multiple phylo rates cause clade differences (see a Fritz paper).

see doc/iucn for data legal etc.
